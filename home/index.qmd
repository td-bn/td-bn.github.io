Teliwain daand referred to bulls who used to move around in circles while 
grouding mustard seeds to produce mustard oil in my native land.

See a video of how it worked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tssx0SRIw9k).

I think that bull is a good analogy for the human existence - we are all blind to the bigger picture,
we move around in circles (hopefully helixes), and we carry our owner version of loads without 
knowing how it all comes together.

But being such a being does not mean that we cannot improve things around us.

Like the telwain daand, I want to add some value to the world.
